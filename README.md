Project Two: Antonia Njoku, Elizabeth Shaw, Mustafa Ancin, Patrick Cardozo
We are choosing to explore the dataset of registered US patents as provided by patentsview.org. We hope to see what industries are the most active/spending money on innovation and therefore are the most likely to have extra funds to hire superfluous people such as data analysts. 
Patent information can be downloaded via csv or api. This information encompasses such parameters as patent location, patent filer name, and patent industry category. 
Example of dataset: http://www.patentsview.org/api/locations/query?q=%7B%22assignee_first_name%22:[%22cardozo%22,%22lewis%22,%22duperval%22]%7D&f=[%22assignee_lastknown_city%22,%22assignee_lastknown_state%22,%22assignee_lastknown_country%22]

Our final product includes a leaflet interactive map of patent filing locations and industry heat map. It will also an interactive line graph showing amount of patents filed across time and category in the United States. After further exploration, we will showcase datapoints of extremity including, for example, who filed the most patents. This will be displayed via drop down menu.
